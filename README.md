# _Personal-Library_

## Description

This application provides a user with the opportunity to create a personal library of books, with the ability to create and store notes related to each book.

Books are entered by title, author ID and book cover image.  The entire library can be viewed, and individual books selected, where notes can be added and deleted.
## Installation

Clone the repository, run npm install, and execute the server.js file from the terminal.  This will create the connection to the host and to the database.  Use your browser to access the user interface.

## Usage

The landing page asks if the user wants to view their library, or add a book. When the library is viewed, the user can click on the cover image of any book to access additional information about the book, including notes.  The user can add and delete notes from this screen.

When adding a book, a form is provided to collect the information needed to add the book to the database.
